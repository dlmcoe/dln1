1)	What is Deep learning ?

Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning (ML) that concerns artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, and are composed of interconnected nodes or neurons. These neurons can process and transmit information, allowing ANNs to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. Deep learning architectures typically consist of multiple layers of neurons, hence the term "deep".
